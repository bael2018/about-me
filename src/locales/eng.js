    aboutMeMessage: 'A promising and young developer with a great desire to develop and learn new technologies. I started my career as a programmer with programming courses at that time I knew nothing about this incomprehensible world of technologies. From that day, I realized that it was quite exciting and tried to devote all my time to programming. After completing the course, I started working as a junior developer in a local company. During my work in the company (5 months) I learned a lot of new things, but most importantly, I got the EXPERIENCE of working in a team. Apart from programming, I like watching movies and playing basketball with my friends.',
